One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”.
The first player thinks(Here-Computer) of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number.
After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess.
Your job is to guess the right number within a limited amount of attempts !
Good luck Guessing !
